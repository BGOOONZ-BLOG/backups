The term **asynchronous** refers to two or more objects or events **not** existing or happening at the same time (or multiple related things happening without waiting for the previous one to complete). In computing, the word "asynchronous" is used in two major contexts.

In December, researchers at the Joint European Torus (JET) started conducting fusion experiments with tritium — a rare and radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The facility is a one-tenth-volume mock-up of the US$22-billion ITER project and has the same doughnut-shaped 'tokamak' design — the world's most developed approach to fusion energy. It is the first time since 1997 that researchers have done experiments in a tokamak with any significant amount of tritium.
