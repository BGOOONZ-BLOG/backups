DevDocs combines multiple API documentations in a fast, organized, and searchable interface. Here's what you should know before you start:

1. Open the [Preferences](https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/settings) to enable more docs and customize the UI.
2. You don't have to use your mouse — see the list of [keyboard shortcuts](https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/help#shortcuts).
3. The search supports fuzzy matching (e.g. "bgcp" brings up "background-clip").
4. To search a specific documentation, type its name (or an abbr.), then Tab.
5. You can search using your browser's address bar — [learn how](https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/help#browser_search).
6. DevDocs works [offline](https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/offline), on mobile, and can be installed on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devdocs/mnfehgbmkapmjnhcnbodoamcioleeooe).
7. For the latest news, follow [@DevDocs](https://twitter.com/DevDocs).
