# W3C Open Source Software

[https://www.w3.org/Status.html](https://www.w3.org/Status.html)

The natural complement to [W3C specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/) is running code. Implementation and testing is an essential part of specification development and releasing the code promotes exchange of ideas in the developer community.

All W3C software is [certified](https://opensource.org/licenses/W3C.php) Open Source/Free Software.

### Version 1.45 of b6+

2021-11-28 The [slide framework b6+](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/) has a couple of new features: 1) When slides are embedded in an `iframe` or `object`, links in the slide replace the parent document, rather than open inside the `iframe`. 2) It is possible to embed a slide as a static page, disabling the navigation to other slides. 3) Accessibility has improved: When switching slides, the new slide is made available to screen readers. See an [explanation of ARIA role=application and aria-live](https://tink.uk/using-the-aria-application-role/) by Léonie Watson. The explanation talks about Shower, but b6+ is similar. 4) When slides do not have ID attributes, you can still start at a specific slide by giving its number as fragment ID. E.g., to open a presentation with slide 25, end the URL with `?full#25`. 5) The F1 key switches to full screen, because not all browsers provide a command for that. 6) Pressing the ‘?' key in slide mode pops up a brief overview of available commands. 7) It is now possible to disable the use of a left mouse click to advance slides. 8) Another option hides the mouse pointer when it doesn't move for some seconds. 9) Various small bug fixes and improvements.

You can read the [manual](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/) or download a [zip file](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/slides.zip) containing the JavaScript file (b6plus.js), a style sheet (simple.css), the manual (Overview.html) and some images used in the manual.

### html-xml-utils 8.0

2021-05-09 Version 8.0 of the [HTML-XML-utils](https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/) adds support for the (proposed) [:is()](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-selectors-4-20181121/#matches) and [:where()](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-selectors-4-20181121/#zero-matches) selectors in `hxselect`.

And it fixes a bug in `hxselect` that caused it to fail on selectors with commas. (With thanks to Bento Borges Schirmer.)

### Version 1.19 of b6+

2020-10-31 The [slide framework b6+](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/) has a new feature: If a slide show is opened with a URL with ‘full' in the query string, the slide show is started in slide mode instead of index mode. If the URL also contains a fragement ID, the slide show is opened on the slide with that ID. E.g.: [https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/Overview.html?full#side](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/Overview.html?full#side)

You can read the [manual](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/) or download a [zip file](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/slides.zip) containing the JavaScript file (b6plus.js), a style sheet (simple.css), the manual (Overview.html) and some images used in the manual.

First released Feb '97, Amaya is not just a browser, but a *hypertext editor*. It's a test-bed for the design of embedded objects, stylesheets, math, structured graphics, and more.  Our contributions to the Apache HTTP server cover bug patches and extensions to the HTTP perl test framework as needed. We have applied all of these patches to our production servers.  Charlint, aka "Charlie", is a perl script that allows you to validate or normalize Unicode (UTF-8) data according to the [Character Model for the World Wide Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-charmod) W3C Working Draft.  The W3C [CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), also known as CSS validator, is a popular free online service to find problems in [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) style sheets used by your HTML pages. The CSS Validator is also [available for download](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/DOWNLOAD.html).  Cwm is a general-purpose data processor for the [semantic web](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/). It is a forward chaining reasoner which can be used for querying, checking, transforming and filtering information. Its core language is [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), extended to include rules, and it uses RDF/XML or N3 serializations as required. [DTD2Schema](https://www.w3.org/2000/04/schema_hack/) A Conversion Tool from DTD to XML Schema  eot-utils [[sources](https://www.w3.org/Tools/eot-utils/)] The eot-utils are the two programs *mkeot* and *eotinfo*. The former creates an [EOT](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/01/) (Embedded OpenType) file from an OpenType or TrueType font and the URLs of one or more Web pages. Unlike Microsoft's [WEFT,](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/WEFT.mspx) *mkeot* is a command-line utility. *mkeot* doesn't subset a font and doesn't currently compress the font data. *mkeot* respects the TrueType "embedding bits." The *eotinfo* program displays the contents of an EOT header in a human-readable way. The programs were tested on Linux (Debian 5 "Lenny") and Mac OS X (10.5 "Snow Leopard") but are expected to work on more systems.  A Web-based framework for creating accessible slide shows with simple markup, and operated like Microsoft PowerPoint. Each presentation is marked up as a single document with links to the slideshow style sheet and script. Each slide is enclosed in a div element with class="slide". The framework includes support for handout notes, incrementally revealing bullet points and graphics overlays, different backgrounds for different slides (div's with class="background"), and guidance on using SVG for anti-aliased graphics that scale with the window size.  Another framework for HTML slide shows. b6+ is a script in JavaScript, which is attached to an HTML file to display the file as a series of slides. Each slide is an element (`div`, `section` or similar) with a class of `slide` (this format is compatible with the [Shower](https://shwr.me/) framework), but it is also possible to just start a slide with an `h1` element without wrapping the slide in an element. The slide then ends at the next `h1`. See the [documentation](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/b6plus/) (which is itself a slide show) for its other features. [HTML Tidy](https://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/) HTML TIDY is a free utility for fixing HTML mistakes automatically and tidying up sloppy editing into nicely laid out markup. It also works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by some specialized HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to pay further attention to making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities. Tidy further provides a simple way to convert HTML to well formed XML, see [WD-html-in-xml](https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/).  A number of simple [C programs for manipulating HTML & XML:](https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/) number headings, make a table of contents, make an index, manage bibliographic references (a simple implementation of refer(1) for HTML), list all links, create cross-references, extract elements that match a (CSS) selector, etc. Most are meant to be used in a Unix pipe or in shell scripts.  The tools consist of three programs: *ical2html* reads an iCalendar (.ics) file, extracts all events between certain dates and of certain categories and creates an HTML page with monthly calendars; *Icalfilter* filters out events of a given category; *icalmerge* merges two or more iCalendar files, keeping only the most recent versions of duplicate events.  IsaViz is a visual environment for browsing and authoring [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) models represented as graphs.  In June 1996, the release of Jigsaw demonstrated object-oriented web server design, written in Java. While it supports HTTP 1.1, traditional file-based resources, and CGI, its strength lies in its resource-based architecture. On this architecture, it supports advanced proxy caching features including ICP, Servlets, PICS, collaborative authoring, and [more](https://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/features.html).  Libwww is a highly modular, general-purpose client side Web API written in C for [Unix and Windows (Win32)](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Platform/). It's well suited for both small and large [applications](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Applications.html). Pluggable [modules provided with libwww](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/) include complete [HTTP/1.1](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#HTTP) (with caching, pipelining, PUT, POST, Digest Authentication, deflate, etc.), [MySQL logging](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#Interface1), [FTP](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#Access), [HTML/4](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#HTML), [XML](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#Expat) (expat), [RDF](https://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#Expat) (SiRPAC), and much more. The purpose of libwww is to serve as a testbed for protocol experiments. **Note:** In addition to the W3C Software License, libwww is covered by a [specific notice](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/libwww-copyright-notice-19980720.html), which includes CERN.  The W3C Link Checker checks that all the links in your HTML document are valid. There is a command-line interface and an [online version](https://validator.w3.org/checklink). The Link Checker can [easily be installed](http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink#install) on one's server.  The [Log Validator](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/LogValidator) is a web server log analysis and validation tool: it can help web content managers find and fix the most frequently accessed invalid documents on their Web site. It is based on a [flexible perl library](http://search.cpan.org/dist/W3C-LogValidator/) that can be used to process lists of Web documents for validation or other tasks.  The W3C Markup Validation Service, also known simply as "[HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/)" is a free online service that helps check Web documents in languages such as HTML, XHTML, SVG, MathML, etc. Its [source code](http://validator.w3.org/source/) is also available, and it is relatively easy to [install](https://validator.w3.org/docs/install.html) on a number of platforms.  The W3C mobileOK checker Java library helps building applications that can assess whether a Web page is [mobileOK Basic](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobileOK-basic10-tests/), highlighting potential problems it would have to be used on a mobile device (such as a phone or a PDA). It serves as a successor to the [mobile web best practices checker](httasp://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/mwbp-validator/).  [RDFPic](https://jigsaw.w3.org/rdfpic/) is a tool to embed an RDF description of a picture into the picture itself, as described by [Describing and retrieving photos using RDF and HTTP](https://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf/). The [version in CVS](https://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/rdfpic/) supports [XMP.](https://www.adobe.com/products/xmp.html)  The [RDF Validator](https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/) checks the syntax of RDF documents, and can produce a graph of any RDF data. Its [java code](https://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/RDFValidator/) can run as a java servlet with jetty, tomcat or Jigsaw. [Installation instructions for Jetty or Tomcat](http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfValidator/Installation) are available on the ESW Wiki.  XSV is a validator for W3C XML Schema, available both for download in source and executable formats, and [online](https://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv).  web-platform-tests is a W3C-coordinated effort to build a cross-browser testsuite for the majority of the Web platform. Its goal is to help achieve interoperability among different implementations.   Hcalproxy runs as a personal proxy and converts (remote) HTML with [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) microformat mark-up to [icalendar.](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt) For example, if `http://example.org/ex.html` is an HTML document, then `http://localhost:8000/http://example.org/ex.html` is an icalendar document with all events from that HTML document.  rdjpgxmp and wrjpgxmp extract and insert XMP data in JPEG (JFIF) files. xmptool can print the value of a particular property in an XMP file, delete a property from an XMP file, or insert a property/value pair into an XMP file.  Unicorn is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services.  Csvtotab converts files of tabular data in comma-separated values (CSV) to tab-separated values, tabtocsv does the opposite. They are intended to be compliant with [Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web.](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model/)  mail-transcode can convert e-mail messages between quoted-printable, base64 and binary encoding, which could be useful in e-mail filters.  This checker performs various tests on a Web page to determine its level of internationalization-friendliness. It also summarizes key internationalization information about a page, such as character encoding and language declarations.  AgendaBot is an IRC robot that watches a channel, looking for lines of the form `agenda: URL`. It tries to parse the document at that URL and extract an agenda, which it then prints on IRC. It understands a few different formats. AgendaBot is especially useful as a complement to [Zakim](https://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html) (but doesn't depend on Zakim).

## Past Projects

Here is the list of [Past Open Source Projects](https://www.w3.org/PastProjects.html) developed at W3C.

## Get involved! Contribute to W3C Open-Source Software

W3C software is free and open source: the software is made primarily *by people of the Web community, for the Web community*.

There are many ways to get involved:

### Help Others

Great communities make great tools, and with only a few minutes of your time you can join the mailing-lists associated with W3C open source projects (such as [www-validator](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/) for the markup validator or [www-validator-css](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-css/) for the CSS validator) and participate in discussions and user support.

A lot of W3C software have a specific user discussion mailing-list (see each projects for details), some also have IRC (chat) channels, such as the #validator channel on the irc.freenode.net for discussions on W3C validation services.

### Write code

Developers are welcome to get involved by contributing code. either to [existing projects](https://www.w3.org/Status.html#list) (see list above and check each project's documentation for contact e-mail information), or [proposed future software](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SoftwareProjects). Patches and [bug fixes](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/) are always welcome, and developers willing to get seriously involved will generally get commit access after a proving period.

As explained [below](https://www.w3.org/Status.html#download), all of W3C software source is [freely available](https://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/), developers are encouraged to get the source for the projects they care about and start hacking right away.

Read the [IPR FAQ on software contribution](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#contribute) if you intend to contribute code. Note that as this license is GPL compatible, it is possible to redistribute software based on W3C sources under a GPL license.

### Send Feedback

Code is not the only way to get involved in making W3C software better. Testing, bug reports, suggestions, or help in creating good documentation are equally important! Most project will have a *Feedback* page, and you can report bugs, test cases and patches on our [Bugzilla](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/).

### Donate

All the tools listed on this page are free and open source, but hosting, maintaining and developing them often costs a lot. With your support through the [Validator Donation Program](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Donate) or the [W3C Supporters Program](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/sponsor/), we can build even better tools.

## Download and Check source code

Most W3C software is available directly [from our CVS base](https://dev.w3.org/) or in our [Mercurial repository](https://dvcs.w3.org/). You can browse the content and history of either through their respective web interfaces.

See the documentation of each software for specific instructions for download and installation.

Some software that was formerly available via FTP at `ftp.w3.org` has been [moved to our web site](https://www.w3.org/2016/11/ftp-shutdown/info.html).
