You can add Netlify CMS [to an existing site](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/), but the quickest way to get started is with a template. Found below, our featured templates deploy a bare-bones site and Netlify CMS to Netlify ([what's the difference, you ask?](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/#netlify-cms-vs-netlify)), giving you a fully working CMS-enabled site with just a few clicks.

After clicking one of those buttons, authenticate with GitHub or GitLab and choose a repository name. Netlify then automatically creates a clone of the repository in your GitHub or GitLab account. Next, it builds and deploys the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard after completing the build.

**Note for Bitbucket users:** Netlify CMS supports Bitbucket repositories, but Bitbucket's permissions won't work with the Deploy to Netlify buttons above. You can still set up a repository manually, or follow the [tutorial](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site) for adding Netlify CMS to an existing site.

1. The template deploy process sends you an invitation to your new site, sent from `no-reply@netlify.com`.
2. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click the link to accept the invite. Your site will open with a prompt to create a password.

    Enter a password, sign in, and you'll go to the CMS. (For future visits, you can go straight to <yoursiteaddress.com>/admin/ .)
    

Try adding and editing posts, or changing the content of the Products page. When you save, the changes are pushed immediately to your Git repository, triggering a build on Netlify, and updating the content on your site. Check out the configuration code by visiting your site repo.
